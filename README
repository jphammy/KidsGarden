BotNet User Manual

Plants beautify our environment and purify the air we breath, improving quality of life. 
But we often forget to take care of it due to our busy lives.The BotNet Smart Flower Pot will 
allow the user to communicate with plants. The device will collect the soil moisture of the plant,
light intensity, temperature and humidity data via advanced sensors. In turn the data is immediately
displayed on the LCD display. Data is uploaded to network via the wireless communication module, where
one can observe it online anytime and anywhere. The unit will alarm the user when the plant requires watering.

This is an introductory, easy to build ESP8266 based environmental plant monitoring system using advanced sensors
to monitor the soil moisture, monitor the sunlight,  and watch temperature and humidity.  It is designed to be easily 
and simply put together and tested with no soldering required.
